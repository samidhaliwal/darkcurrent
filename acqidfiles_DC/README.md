#Acquisifier files for dark current
Created using script in MakeDC_acq directory. The files with no underscore are the original files. The files with suffix TDarkCurrent.acq add temperature readings... found there was a slight error here, so best to use the suffix DarkCurrent.acq files.
Note, at some point the IP address for drivers changed, all files in directory  may not be the correct IP.
